Four Sentence Types
- Declarative Sentences
- Imperative Sentences
- Exclamatory Sentences
- Interrogative Sentences Declarative Sentences Declarative sentences make a statement to relay information or ideas. They are punctuated with a simple period. Formal essays or reports are composed almost entirely of declarative sentences.
Examples of Declarative Sentences:
- The concert begins in two hours.
- July 4th is Independence Day.
- Declarative sentences make a statement.
- Green is my favorite color.
- Hawaii is a tropical climate.
Imperative Sentences Imperative sentences issue commands or requests or they can express a desire or wish. They are punctuated with a simple period or they can be exclamations requiring an exclamation mark. It all depends on the strength of emotion you want to express. Exclamatory sentences can consist of a single verb or they can be more lengthy and complex.
Examples of Imperative Sentences:
- Halt!
- Yield.
- Watch for oncoming traffic.
- Respond immediately.
- Please lower your voice.
- Meet me at the town square.
- Drop what you're doing and come celebrate with us!
Exclamatory Sentences Exclamatory sentences express strong emotion. It doesn't really matter what the emotion is, an exclamatory sentence is the type of sentence needed to express it. Exclamatory sentences always end in an exclamation mark, so it's pretty easy to spot them.Â  Use exclamatory sentences to portray emotion but take care to use them sparingly. Otherwise, your writing will lack sincerity.
Examples of Exclamatory Sentences
- The river is rising!
- I can't wait for the party!
- I don't know what I'll do if I don't pass this test!
- Oh, my goodness, I won!
- Suddenly, a bear appeared in my path!
- This is the best day of my life!
- Please don't go!
Interrogative Sentences Interrogative sentences are also easy to spot. That's because they always ask a question and end in a question mark.
Examples of Interrogative Sentences:
- Is it snowing?
- Have you had breakfast?
- Do you want Coke or Pepsi?
- Who are you taking to the prom?
- You like Mexican food, don't you?
The important thing to take away from this is that when you use the four different sentence types in your writing, your writing is automatically more interesting.
