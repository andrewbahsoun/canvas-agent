- Logic, Propositions, and Arguments:
Logic = methods and principles of correct reasoning.
Reasoning about any matter: to produce Arguments or conclusions that are supported by reasons or Premises. Arguments are conclusions based upon reasons or premises or other propositions.
- What are propositions? They are building blocks of reasoning.
A proposition asserts that something is the case, sometimes called a State of Affairs.
Examples:
"There is life on some other planet in our galaxy." or "The Instructor is standing before the class." A Proposition declares that something is the case.
Propositions are either true or false.
Questions ("Do you know how to play chess?"), Commands ("Come here quickly!"), Exclamations ("Wow!") are neither true nor false.
- The Construction of Arguments We use Propositions to construct Arguments.
In any Argument we reason or infer one Proposition from other propositions or premises:
Premise #1: Socrates is a man.
Premise #2: All men are mortal.
Conclusion: Socrates is mortal.
So an Argument is a set of propositions in which a conclusion is said to follow from the premises.
- Identifying Premises and Conclusions
- Premise Indicators: since, because, for, as, follows from, as shown by, inasmuch as.
Conclusion Indicators: therefore, hence, so, accordingly, consequently, as a result, thus, hence.
- Finding the Argument
- Often an Argument is not obvious or may be hidden: the conclusion may precede the premises. E. G. Socrates is going to die. He is like all men. All men live and then die.
Example of an Argument on Reason and Faith: Luther's Argument "Reason is the greatest enemy that faith has; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things, but more frequently than not struggles against the divine Word, treating with contempt all that emanates from God."
- Martin Luther, Last Sermon in Wittenburg, 17 January 1546.
Reconstruction of Luther's Argument: Finding the Argument Premise #1: Reason never perceives spiritual truth or matters of faith.
Premise #2: Reason opposes the search for spiritual truth or matters of faith.
Conclusion: Reason is the greatest enemy of matters of faith.
- Three Basic Laws of Logic The three fundamental laws of logic, also known as the laws of thought, are essential principles that underpin classical logic and rational discourse. They are:
- The Law of Identity:
Proposition: A is A.
Explanation: This law states that an object is identical to itself. In other words, everything is what it is, and not something else. If a statement is true, then it is true.
Example: If we say "A cat is a cat," we are affirming the identity of the cat with itself.
- The Law of Non-Contradiction:
Proposition: A cannot be both A and not A at the same time and in the same respect.
Explanation: This law asserts that contradictory statements cannot both be true simultaneously. It means that a proposition and its negation cannot both be true.
Example: The statement "It is raining" and "It is not raining" cannot both be true at the same time and place.
- The Law of Excluded Middle:
Proposition: Either A or not A.
Explanation: This law states that for any proposition, either that proposition is true, or its negation is true. There is no middle ground or third option.
Example: "The light is either on or off." There is no third option in this binary situation.
These laws form the foundation of classical logic and are crucial for rational reasoning and argumentation.
