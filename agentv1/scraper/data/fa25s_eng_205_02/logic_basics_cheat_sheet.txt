Logic Basics: Cheat Sheet
- Logic, Propositions, and Arguments:
Logic = methods and principles of correct reasoning.
Reasoning about any matter: to produce Arguments or conclusions that are supported by reasons or Premises. Arguments are conclusions based upon reasons or premises or other propositions.
- What are propositions? They are building blocks of reasoning.
A proposition asserts that something is the case, sometimes called a State of Affairs.
Examples:
"There is life on some other planet in our galaxy." Or "The Instructor is standing before the class." A Proposition declares that something is the case.
Propositions are either true or false.
Questions ("Do you know how to play chess?"), Commands ("Come here quickly!"), Exclamations ("Wow!") are neither true nor false.
- The Construction of Arguments We use Propositions to construct Arguments.
In any Argument we reason or infer one Proposition from other propositions or premises. Premises are the Reasons for drawing a conclusion Premise #1: Socrates is a man.
Premise #2: All men are mortal.
Conclusion: Socrates is mortal.
So an Argument is a set of propositions in which a conclusion is said to follow from the premises.
- Identifying Premises and Conclusions
- Premise Indicators: since, because, for, as, follows from, as shown by, inasmuch as.
Conclusion Indicators: therefore, hence, so, accordingly, consequently, as a result, thus, hence.
