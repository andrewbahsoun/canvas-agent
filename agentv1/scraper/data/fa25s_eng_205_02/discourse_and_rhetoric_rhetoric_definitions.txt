Discourse and Rhetoric Discourse:
- A discourse can be any speech, written or spoken, as well as the exchange or symbols or meanings in any context: books, newspapers, pictures, movies, Web sites, music, and so on.
- In linguistics, discourse refers to a unit of language longer than a single sentence. More broadly, discourse is the use of spoken or written language in a social context.
- While every act of communication can count as an example of discourse, some scholars have broken discourse down into four primary types: argument, narration, description, and exposition. Many acts of communication include more than one of these types in quick succession.
- Basically, it [discourse] is language which is understood as utterance and this involves subjects who speak and write --- which presupposes listeners and readers who, in a sense, are 'objects'. Thus, in theory at any rate, discourse might include any modes of utterance as a part of social practice. They [modes of discourse] are differentiated by their intention. Thus, discourse may be poetry or prose … a philosophical essay, a political tract, a biblical commentary…. It may be any number of things. (Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory, J. A, Cudden and C. E. Preston (Eds.), Penguin, 1992)
- "Systems of thoughts composed of ideas, attitudes, and courses of action, beliefs and practices that systematically construct the subjects and the worlds of which they speak." (Foucault, 2010, Archaeology of Knowledge, Vintage, chapter 3) Rhetoric:
What is Rhetoric?
Rhetoric refers to the study and uses of written, spoken and visual language. It investigates how language is used to organize and maintain social groups, construct meanings and identities, coordinate behavior, mediate power, produce change, and create knowledge. Rhetoricians often assume that language is constitutive (we shape and are shaped by language), dialogic (it exists in the shared territory between self and other), closely connected to thought (mental activity as "inner speech") and integrated with social, cultural and economic practices. Rhetorical study and written literacy are understood to be essential to civic, professional and academic life.
Rhetoric began 2500 years ago as the study of the forms of communication and argument essential to public, political and legal life in Ancient Greece. It has since evolved a rich and diverse body of research, texts, and pedagogies (SDSU) Let rhetoric be [defined as] an ability, in each [particular] case, to see the available means of persuasion. (Aristotle) I tell the students in my undergraduate rhetorical theory class that the study of rhetoric is the study of how we use language and how language uses us). (Krista Ratcliffe) What rhetoric has always addressed: not the mastery and regulation of language so much as the ways in which language shapes, reflects, and changes practices among members of particular communities. (Christine Farris) Rhetoric is the art of describing reality through language. Under this definition, the study of rhetoric becomes an effort to understand how humans, in various capacities and in a variety of situations, describe reality through language. To act rhetorically is to use language in asserting or seeming to assert claims about reality. At the heart of this definition is the assumption that what renders discourse potentially persuasive is that a rhetor (e.g. a speaker or writer) implicitly or explicitly sets forth claims that either differ from or cohere with views of reality held by audiences (e.g. a specific scholarly community, a reader of fiction, or an assembly of persons attending a political rally). (Cherwitz and Hikins, Communication and Knowledge: An Investigation in Rhetorical Epistemology. 62) What happens, then, if we choose to begin with our knowledge that we are essentially creatures made in symbolic exchange, created in the process of sharing intentions, values, meanings, in fact more like each other than different, more valuable in our commonality than in our idiosyncrasies: not, in fact, anything at all when considered separately from our relations? What happens if we think of ourselves as essentially participants in a field or process or mode of being persons together? If man is essentially a rhetorical animal, in the sense that his nature is discovered and lived only in symbolic process, then the whole world shifts: even the usage of words like I, my, mine, self, must be reconsidered, because the borderlines between the self and the other have either disappeared or shifted sharply . . . All we need do is honour what we know about who we are and how we come to be, in language. Once we give up the limiting notions of language and knowledge willed to us by scientism [scientific methodology], we can no longer consider adequate any notion of "language as a means of communication" . . . It is, in recent models, the medium in which selves grow, the social invention through which we make each other and the structures that are our world, the shared product of our efforts to cope with experience. (Wayne Booth, 1974) Rhetoric has a number of overlapping meanings: the practice of oratory; the study of the strategies of effective oratory; the use of language, written or spoken, to inform or persuade; the study of the persuasive effects of language; the study of the relation between language and knowledge; the classification and use of tropes and figures; and, of course, the use of empty promises and half-truths as a form of propaganda. Nor does this list exhaust the definitions that might be given. Rhetoric is a complex discipline with a long history: It is less helpful to try to define it once and for all than to look at the many definitions it has accumulated over the years and to attempt to understand how each arose and how each still inhabits and shapes the field. (Patricia Bizzell and Bruce Herzberg, 2001, "General Introduction." In Bizzell and Herzberg (Eds.), The Rhetorical Tradition: Readings from Classical Times to the Present, p 1) "The use of words by human agents to form attitudes or induce actions in other human agents." "The use of language as a symbolic means of inducing cooperation in beings that by nature respond to symbols." Kenneth Burke Rhetoric Definitions
