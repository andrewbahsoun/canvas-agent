- Research Basics In a research argument, you make a claim, back it with reasons supported by evidence, acknowledge and respond to other views, and sometimes explain your principles of reasoning.
- A claim is an assertion (which can be a single sentence of more) that demands support: "Climate changes is threatening coastal cities." Some call this your thesis.
- A reason is an assertion that supports a claim. [Because] "Climate change is causing ocean levels to rise."
- Evidence is data deployed to support a reason. Unlike a claim or reason, evidence is not always framed as an assertion, e.g., data tables may replace actual assertions showing rising ocean levels over the past decade.
- Facts, Interpretations and Objectivity
- Evidence: To count as evidence, a statement must report something that readers agree not to question, at least for the purpose of the argument.
- Evidence implies Interpretation: When we talk about evidence, we typically use foundational metaphors: good evidence is solid, hard, the bedrock foundation on which we build arguments, something we can see for ourselves. Bad evidence is flimsy, weak, or thin. Language like this encourages readers to think of evidence as a reality independent of anyone's interpretation and judgment. But data (facts) are always constructed and shaped by those who collect and use them as evidence. As you build your argument, keep in mind that your evidence will count as evidence only if your readers accept it without question.
- Data/Facts: When you report the data (facts) as your own evidence, you cannot avoid manipulating them, at least by putting them in a new context. Even if you collected the data yourself, you tidied them up, making them seem more coherent than what you actually saw, counted, and recorded in your notes. In fact, before you started collecting any facts at all, you had to decide what to count, how to categorize the numbers, how to order them, whether to present them in the form of a table, bar chart, or graph. Even photographs and video recording reflect a particular point of view. In short, facts are shaped by those who collect them and again by the intentions of those who use them.
- Evaluating Your Evidence: An argument
- Child: I need new sneakers. These are too small.
- Parent: Your feet haven't grown that much in a month, and they don't seem to hurt you
- much.
- Child: But they're too grungy for school. Look at this dirt and these raggedy laces.
- Parent: The dirt will wash off and the laces can be replaced. That's not enough to buy
- new sneakers.
- Child: They hurt. Look at how I limp.
- Parent: You were walking fine a minute ago.
- Child: Everybody thinks I should get new sneakers. Harry said so.
- Parent: Harry's opinion doesn't matter in this house.
- Evaluating Your Evidence: An argument: Revised
- Child: I need new sneakers (c). These are too small (e).
- Parent: Your feet haven't grown that much in a month, and they don't seem to hurt you
- much. (Rejection of evidence.)
- Child: But they're too grungy for school (r). Look at this dirt and these raggedy laces (e).
- Parent: The dirt will wash off and the laces can be replaced. That's not enough to buy
- new sneakers. (Possible acceptance of evidence but another interpretation.)
- Child: They hurt (r). Look at how I limp (e).
- Parent: You were walking fine a minute ago. (Rejection of evidence.)
- Child: Everybody thinks I should get new sneakers (r). Harry said so (e).
Parent: Harry's opinion doesn't matter in this house. (Rejection of Harry as an authoritative source.)
