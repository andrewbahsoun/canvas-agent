Abstract Purpose as contrast with a Thesis Statement The purpose of an abstract in a research paper is to provide a brief summary of the entire study. It typically includes the research question or objective, methods used, key findings, and conclusions-all condensed into a paragraph of about 150-250 words. The abstract helps readers quickly understand what the paper is about and decide whether to read the full paper.
Key Features of an Abstract:
- Concise summary of the entire paper
- Includes purpose, methodology, results, and conclusions
- Appears at the beginning of the paper, before the introduction
- Written after the paper is completed
- Used in databases for search and indexing The thesis statement, on the other hand, is a one- or two-sentence claim or argument that clearly states the main idea or central purpose of the paper. It is usually found at the end of the introduction and serves to guide the paper's structure and direction.
Key Features of a Thesis Statement:
- Presents the main argument or claim
- Guides the development of the paper
- Appears in the introduction
- Usually does not summarize the entire study
- Focused and specific to the author's position or purpose Abstract Purpose as contrast with a Thesis Statement
