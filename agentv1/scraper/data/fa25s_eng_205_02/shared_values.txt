IDENTIFYING SHARED VALUES "A good question to ask when analyzing rhetoric [any spoken or written language], then is this: What is it that the speaker assumes (or implies) that everyone in the room knows or believes? By definition, these are things that are unlikely to be stated explicitly, as they don't need to be. But at the same time, rhetors [authors, speakers] constantly give out clues: the inclusion of Biblical references implies a familiarity with the Christian cultural tradition, if not direct knowledge of the Bible itself. Nor it is only language that gives out these hints" (Richard Toye, Rhetoric 52).
Ask Yourself these Questions:
- In what texts or situations has the term or phrase been used?
- Are there direct or indirect allusions to other texts, religious traditions, historical situations, or cultural associations? (Henley, "The Heart of the Matter")
- IF the text is from the Western tradition, are there allusions to the Judeo-Christian tradition? (Hemingway, The Sun Also Rises epigraph)
- If the text is from the Eastern tradition, are there allusions to that tradition? (Herman Hesse, Siddhartha)
- How do we use the term or phrase in ordinary language? Is that meaning different from previous historical periods? (Housman, "Epitaph")
- Does the author use the term or phrase outside its ordinary meaning? And if so, why and for what effect?
