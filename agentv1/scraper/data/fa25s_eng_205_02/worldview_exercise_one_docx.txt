(From: https://www.yourdictionary.com/worldview)
- A worldview is a collection of attitudes, values, stories and expectations about the world around us, which inform our every thought and action. Worldview is expressed in ethics, religion, philosophy, scientific beliefs and so on (Sire, 2004). A worldview is how a culture works out meaning in individual practice. When you encounter a situation and think 'That's OK for others to suffer for my well-being and benefit. Your worldview is active. When you encounter a situation and think 'That's just wrong', your worldview is also active. We have a natural tendency to think that what we believe is normal, but others' worldviews are backward and superstitious.; your views. are a result of how you were brought up; my views are rational, balanced and true. We are largely unaware of the wheels moving on our car until there is an abnormal noise; similarly, we become aware of worldviews and their corresponding values only when there is a clash or crisis (Fulford, 2011). (Gray AJ. Worldviews. Int Psychiatry. 2011 Aug 1;8(3):pp. 58-60).
