How to Read an Academic Journal 1. Explain the Conventional Structure of an Academic Journal Article
- Title - Indicates the focus of the study
- Abstract - A summary of the article's purpose, methods, results, and conclusion
- Introduction - States the research question or thesis and reviews existing literature
- Methods - Describes how the research was conducted
- Results - Presents the data collected
- Discussion - Interprets results and their implications
- Conclusion - Summarizes findings and potential applications
- References - Lists sources cited 2. Teach a Strategic Reading Process Academic articles are dense, so students should read selectively and purposefully:
Step 1: Skim First
- Read the title, abstract, and conclusion to determine relevance.
- Look at headings, figures, and tables.
Step 2: Read the Introduction Thoroughly
- Identify the research question or thesis.
- Understand the context and gap in the literature.
Step 3: Review Methods and Results Critically
- Focus on understanding what was done and what was found.
- Don't worry if the stats are complex-focus on key outcomes.
Step 4: Engage with the Discussion
- See how the authors interpret their findings.
- Ask whether you agree with their interpretation.
3. Teach Annotation and Note-Taking Encourage students to:
- Highlight key points
- Write marginal notes
- Summarize each section in their own words
- Ask questions in the margins 4. Teach Critical Evaluation Students should be able to ask:
- What is the research question?
- Is the methodology sound?
- Are the conclusions supported by the data?
- What are the limitations of the study?
- How does it connect to other readings?
5. Provide Practice Assign journal articles for:
- Group reading with guided questions
- Journal clubs where students present an article to peers
- Summarization tasks (e.g., write an abstract or paraphrase the discussion) 6. Reinforce With Tools and Checklists Give students:
- A reading guide or worksheet
- Access to glossaries or research vocab lists
- Models of well-annotated articles Link to a short video on dilemma of research for new college students: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWNGZUa952A
