Definition of Critical Thinking Critical thinking is the ability to think clearly, rationally, and independently, analyzing information and arguments in a disciplined and reflective way to make reasoned judgments. It involves evaluating evidence, identifying biases or assumptions, recognizing logical connections, and solving problems systematically.
Key characteristics of critical thinking include:
- Analysis - breaking down complex information into parts.
- Evaluation - assessing the credibility of sources and the strength of arguments.
- Inference - drawing conclusions based on evidence and reasoning.
- Explanation - articulating findings clearly and coherently.
- Self-regulation - reflecting on one's own beliefs, values, and thought processes.
