 --- Slide 7 --- # Logical Form of the Argumentative Essay
- Logical Form of the Argumentative Essay
- Thesis: the main Claim or assertion.
- Example: A claim is an assertion (which can be a single sentence of more) that demands support: "Climate change is threatening coastal cities." Some call this your thesis.
- The Thesis summarizes the reasons that support your Claim.
- Literature Review: A discussion of the current state of affairs reading the Claim. This usually is for a more complex research project and often includes how your Claim addresses a gap in the research.
- Reasons: Your evidence to support your Claim or thesis
- Conclusion: a restatement and summary of your Thesis

 --- Slide 8 --- # Research Sources Overview
- Research Sources Overview
- Authorship: Credentials: Check the author's qualifications, expertise, and affiliations and reputation.
- Publication Source: Peer-Reviewed Journals: Articles published in peer-reviewed journals are generally considered high quality.
- Date of Publication: Timeliness: Ensure the source is current and relevant to your topic.
- Bias and Objectivity: Balanced Perspective: Assess whether the source presents information objectively and acknowledges potential biases.
- Funding Sources: Be cautious of research funded by organizations with a vested interest in the outcomes.
- References and Citations and methodology
- Comprehensive Bibliography: Reliable sources cite other high-quality research.
 --- Slide 9 --- # Key Research Documentation Methods
- Key Research Documentation Methods
- APA (American Psychological Association) --- used in social sciences, education, economics, nursing, criminology.
- MLA (Modern Language Association) --- used in humanities English and literary studies, history, and foreign languages.
- Chicago Style --- used in publishing, history, art history, anthropology, literature, music.

 --- Slide 10 --- # Purposes of Documentation Methods
- Purposes of Documentation Methods
- Crediting Sources and establishing authority
- Facilitating uniformity in research
- Facilitating academic discourse
- Avoiding plagiarism by uniform standards of expression
- Demonstrating research rigor

 --- Slide 12 --- # Critical Methodologies
- Critical Methodologies
- Quantitative Method
- Discovering FACTS
- Usually limited to measurement and numerical analyses
- Statistical Inferences to general conclusions
- Assumes a fixed sense of reality and a uniformity in human experience
- Qualitative Method
- Concerned to understand nuances and complexities
- Not limited to quantification
- Use of participant observation and interviews
- Dependence on the individual's perspective
- Assumes a complex and nuanced concept of reality

- "When in Doubt, Shout! Paradoxical Influences of Doubt on Proselytizing"
- A quantitative Analysis on effect of prompting doubt in one's beliefs.
- By: David Gal and Derek D. Rucker: Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University
 --- Slide 14 --- # Key Research Questions
- Key Research Questions
- When an individual's faith is questioned, what are the probable results?
- Example: When one's religious beliefs are shaken, is one more or less likely to advocate those beliefs to others?
- T
 --- Slide 15 --- # Quantitative Method Foundation
- Quantitative Method Foundation
- Choice of a group to analyze and justification of random and representative sampling
- Primary use of measurement and statistical analysis
- Inductive method of drawing general conclusions from a basket of individual cases
- A general lack of concern for the individual's "Lived Experience" of doubt
 --- Slide 16 --- # Quantitative Analysis Conclusion:"When in Doubt Shout" Article
- Quantitative Analysis Conclusion:"When in Doubt Shout" Article
- "In the research presented in this article, we experimentally examined the link between shaken beliefs and advocacy. One [accepted] perspective is that shaken confidence should decrease proselytizing [others]" (1701).
- "However, we propose that people might be more likely to advocate their beliefs when their confidence in those beliefs is temporarily shaken. This proposition is based on two assumptions: First, the beliefs and attitudes individuals hold are important in defining their self-concept (such that shaken confidence in a closely held belief functions as a threat), and second, advocacy can serve as a means to bolster these beliefs" (1702).
- In short, when one's beliefs are threatened one doubles down and tries to convert others to the faith to mitigate their anxiety. Freud would call this a reaction formation: a defense mechanism in which a person expresses the opposite of their true feelings to avoid anxiety. Sartre calls this Self-Deception.
 --- Slide 17 --- # Qualitative Method
- Qualitative Method
- Minimal reliance on numbers and statistics
- Key focus on the "Lived Experience" of a person and one that is not usually transferable to others
- Experience is individual and nuanced
- Like an anthropologist, qualitative research is telling individual stories.
- Minimal to no reliance on drawing general conclusions from an individual's life experience.
- Sources of qualitative research usually can include personal documents, e.g., journals, films, recordings, letters.
- LIFE IS PERSONAL
 --- Slide 18 --- # Qualitative Method Conclusions
- Qualitative Method Conclusions
- The "Lived experience" of Doubt varies with each individual and cannot be determined for a group of people without abbreviating, and thus misrepresenting, reality.
- The complexity of an individual's life transcends general propositions or characterizations.
- Instances of doubt can range from a questioning of one's World View (a system of beliefs) to depression and lack of ability to act and live or doubling down.
- When in Doubt Shout's conclusions are simply one point of view and not a definitive explanation.
 --- Slide 19 --- # Question: What Fundamental Concepts underly RESEARCH
- Question: What Fundamental Concepts underly RESEARCH
- The Concept of Methodic Doubt
- The Concept of Critical Thinking
- T
 --- Slide 20 --- # Methodic Doubt --- Rene Descartes
- Methodic Doubt --- Rene Descartes
- Reason now leads me to think that I should hold back my assent from opinions which are not completely certain and indubitable just as carefully as I do from those which are patently false. So, for the purpose of rejecting all my opinions, it will be enough if I find in each of them at least some reason for doubt. (AT 7:18, CSM 2:12)
 --- Slide 21 --- # Examples of Methodic Doubt
- Examples of Methodic Doubt
- "In order to seek truth, it is necessary once in the course of our life to doubt, as far as possible, of all things." René Descartes
- "Scepticism is the first step towards truth." Denis Diderot
- "Blind belief in authority is the greatest enemy of truth." Albert Einstein
- "There are no facts, only interpretations." Friedrich Nietzsche
- "The truth is rarely pure and never simple." Oscar Wilde
 --- Slide 22 --- # The Quintessential Concept of Methodic Doubt
- The Quintessential Concept of Methodic Doubt
- F. Scott Fitzgerald
- "The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function."

- Critical Thinking ----A Simplified Understanding
- CRITICAL THINKING IS THE USE OF:
- LOGICAL PRINCIPLES AND
- CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS
 --- Slide 25 --- # Critical Thinking --- An Overview
- Critical Thinking --- An Overview
- Critical thinking is the intellectually disciplined process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action (criticalthinking.org.).
- The ability to think critically, as conceived in this volume, involves three things: ( 1 ) an attitude of being disposed to consider in a thoughtful way the problems and subjects that come within the range of one's experiences, (2) knowledge of the methods of logical inquiry and reasoning, and (3) some skill in applying those methods. Critical thinking calls for a persistent effort to examine any belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the evidence that supports it and the further conclusions to which it tends. (Edward Glaser)

- Book as a symbol of education?
- Axe as a symbol of what a book should do?
- Frozen self as a symbol of alienation from others and hiding the true self?

- What is Kafka trying to say about the value of an Education?
- Book as a symbol of education?
- Axe as a symbol of what a book should do?
- Frozen self as a symbol of alienation from others and hiding the true self?
- An education should:
- Challenge our sense of values and beliefs ----- our world view
