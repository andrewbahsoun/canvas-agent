 --- Slide 2 ---
- Pre-Class Question
- What database words did we learn last class?
 --- Slide 3 ---
- ER Model: Design Phase of Database
- An Entity Relationship Model is the first phase in developing a new database
- It can address questions about what information will be stored in our database, how elements relate to one another, and what constraints are needed
 --- Slide 4 ---
- DESIGN PHASE (EXAMPLE)
- An ER model for a music application can address questions about what information will be stored:
- Songs, Artists, Albums
- How elements relate to one another:
- Artists release Albums with Songs on them
- And what constraints are needed:
- Keys, Data Types, References
 --- Slide 5 ---
- ENTITY
- An Entity is some sort of object or "thing" that can have an independent existence.
- This could be something physical like a chair or a table, or it could be something more abstract like a college course or a job.
 --- Slide 6 ---
- ATTRIBUTE
- An Attribute is any sort of property that describes an entity.
- You could say any instance of a table has a color, a height, a location, and so on.
 --- Slide 7 ---
- RELATIONSHIP
- A Relationship is a connection among two entities
- Relationships can also help decide the complexity of inserting data into our tables and getting it back out again.
 --- Slide 8 ---
- ER Diagrams
- Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ER Diagrams) are how we use the entities and relationships from our scenario and sketch out a first rough draft for our database.
- These can either be drawn on paper or on some online chart maker. (I use LucidChart)
 --- Slide 9 ---
- ER Diagrams
- Things we decide at this step:
- What entities we want our database to store
- What attributes we will use to describe them
- What relationships our entities will have
- What kind of relationships these will be
 --- Slide 10 ---
- ER Diagrams
- Things we decide later:
- Every single table that will be in our database
- What our database schema will look like
- How we will implement our relationships
 --- Slide 11 ---
- ER Diagrams
- There are a wide variety of notation styles used for creating ER Diagrams, and the one we will be using is the Chen notation style.
 --- Slide 12 ---
- Creating an ER Diagram
- An Entity is represented in the ER Model by a rectangle. These will be all of the things your database is choosing to store information about.
 --- Slide 13 ---
- Creating an ER Diagram
- An attribute of an entity is represented by an oval.
- The key attribute of the entity will be underlined
 --- Slide 14 ---
- Creating an ER Diagram
- We connect entities to their respective attributes using lines
 --- Slide 15 ---
- Creating an ER Diagram
- Relationships between entities are represented with diamonds
 --- Slide 16 ---
- RELATIONSHIP
- There are four types of relationships:
- One to one
- One to many
- Many to one
- Many to many
 --- Slide 17 ---
- ONE TO ONE RELATIONSHIP
- When a single instance of an entity is associated with a single instance of another entity, at most, this is a one-to-one relationship
- Example: One person only has one SSN, and each SSN is assigned to only one person.
 --- Slide 18 ---
- ONE TO MANY RELATIONSHIP
- When a single instance of an entity is associated with multiple instances of another entity, at most, this is a one-to-many relationship
- Example: An astronaut can only work at one agency, but an agency can employ multiple astronauts
 --- Slide 19 ---
- MANY TO ONE RELATIONSHIP
- When multiple instances of an entity are associated with a single instance of another entity, at most, this is a many-to-one relationship. This is the exact same thing as one-to-many, you are just starting from the second entity instead of the first. You could use both to describe the same relationship.
- Example: A college can enroll many students but a student cannot be enrolled in many colleges.
 --- Slide 20 ---
- MANY TO MANY RELATIONSHIP
- When multiple instances of an entity are associated with multiple instances of another entity, at most, this is a many-to-many relationship
- Example: Astronauts can go on many Expeditions, and Expeditions can have many astronauts.
 --- Slide 21 ---
- Cardinality
- We call which of these four options any relationship has the cardinality of that relationship
 --- Slide 22 ---
- Cardinality
- The cardinality of a relationship is shown on an ER model with a 1 or M on either side of the relationship
- M
