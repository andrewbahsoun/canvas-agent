- ER Model Example
- CPSC408
 --- Slide 2 ---
- Case Study
- A car insurance company approaches us and asks for a plan for their accident management system. This system needs to store information about Customers, Cars, and Accidents.
- Each customer has a member ID, name, email, phone number, and one or more cars
- Each car has a car ID, make, model, year, and zero or more accidents it's been in
- Each accident has a claim ID, a date, location, and damage dollar amount

- Case Study
- Let's construct our ER Diagram based off of these parameters.

- Case Study
- Our entities each have attributes
- Customers:
- memberID, name, email, phoneNumber
- Cars:
- carID, make, model, year
- Accidents:
- claimID, location, date, damageTotal

- Case Study
- Our entities each have relationships
- A customer can have one or more car
- A car can have zero or more accidents
 --- Slide 10 ---
- Case Study
- Our entities each have relationships
- A customer can have one or more car:
- For each customer, there can be many cars
- For each car, there can only be one customer
- The relationship between customer and car is one to many
- (Note, the opposite relationship between car and customer is many-to-one. This describes the same type of relationship, you just always start with the entity you are describing first.)

- Case Study
- Our entities each have relationships
- A car can have zero or more accidents:
- For each car there can be many accidents
- For each accident, the insurance claim is for one car
- The relationship between cars and accidents is one to many

- A Note on Relationships
- In ER Model examples you find online, you will sometimes see shorthand for "One" and "Many" that look like the below. A "One" is represented by two parallel lines, and a "Many" is represented by an arrow and a line. Both are valid notation for relationships on the ER Model, feel free to use either when creating your charts.
