 5.1 Introduction - Digital building blocks:
- Gates, multiplexers, decoders, registers, arithmetic circuits, counters, memory arrays, logic arrays - Building blocks demonstrate hierarchy, modularity, and regularity:
- Hierarchy of simpler components - Well-defined interfaces and functions - Regular structure easily extended to different sizes - Will use many of these building blocks to build a microprocessor in Chapter 7 Copyright © 2007 Elsevier 5-<3>

 Multibit Adder, also called CPA - Several types of carry propagate adders (CPAs) are:
- Ripple-carry adders (slow) - Carry-lookahead adders (fast) - Prefix adders (faster) - Carry-lookahead and prefix adders are faster for large adders but require more hardware.

 5.2.5Shifters - Logical shifter: shifts value to left or right and fills empty spaces with 0's - Ex: 11001 >> 2 = - Ex: 11001 << 2 = - Arithmetic shifter: same as logical shifter, but on right shift, fills empty spaces with the old most significant bit (msb).
- Ex: 11001 >>> 2 = - Ex: 11001 <<< 2 = - Rotator: rotates bits in a circle, such that bits shifted off one end are shifted into the other end - Ex: 11001 ROR 2 = - Ex: 11001 ROL 2 = 5-<12>
 Shifters - Logical shifter: shifts value to left or right and fills empty spaces with 0's - Ex: 11001 >> 2 = 00110 - Ex: 11001 << 2 = 00100 - Arithmetic shifter: same as logical shifter, but on right shift, fills empty spaces with the old most significant bit (msb).
- Ex: 11001 >>> 2 = 11110 - Ex: 11001 <<< 2 = 00100 - Rotator: rotates bits in a circle, such that bits shifted off one end are shifted into the other end - Ex: 11001 ROR 2 = 01110 - Ex: 11001 ROL 2 = 001115-<13>
 Shifters as Multipliers and Dividers - A left shift by N bits multiplies a number by 2N - Ex: 00001 << 2 = 00100 (1 × 22 = 4) - Ex: 11101 << 2 = 10100 (-3 × 22 = -12) - The arithmetic right shift by N divides a number by 2N - Ex: 01000 >>> 2 = 00010 (8 ÷ 22 = 2) - Ex: 10000 >>> 2 = 11100 (-16 ÷ 22 = -4) 5-<14>
 5.3 Number Systems - What kind of numbers do you know ?
- How to represent using binary representations?
- Positive numbers - Unsigned binary - Negative numbers - Two's complement - Sign/magnitude numbers - What about fractions?

 5.4 Sequential Building Blocks 5.4.1 Counters - Increments on each clock edge.
- Used to cycle through numbers. For example, - 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111, 000, 001… - Example uses:
- Digital clock displays - Program counter: keeps track of current instruction executing Symbol Implementation CLK CLK N N N Q + Q r N N Reset Reset 5-<16>
