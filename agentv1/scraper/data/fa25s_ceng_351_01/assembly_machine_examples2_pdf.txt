6.14 Convert the following program from machine language into MIPS assembly language.
The numbers on the left are the instruction addresses in memory, and the numbers on the right give the instruction at that address. Then reverse engineer a high-level program that would compile into this assembly language routine and write it. Explain in words what the program does. $a0 is the input, and it initially contains a positive number, n. $v0 is the output.
