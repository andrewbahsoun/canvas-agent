How to Search for GE Courses 1. Log in to your student center and click on the Manage Classes icon.
2. Click Class Search and Enroll, Fall 2025, and Additional Ways to Search.
 3. Click Class Attribute, and you will see the different GE categories. You must reference your Program Evaluation to determine which GEs you still have remaining to graduate. Once you select a GE you want to focus on, click search.
4. The following webpage that loads will provide you with a list of approved classes for satisfying that specific GE requirement. I also recommend selecting the open classes only button in the upper left-hand corner; this way, you are only being shown open classes.
 5. Always click on the class to see if there are any restrictions on taking the class. For example, some classes require prerequisites to enroll in the class.
Additionally, some departments save seats for students enrolled in specific majors, minors, or themed inquiries.
 6. Once you find a class that interests you, click on the arrow and add the course to your shopping cart. Once you add all your courses to the shopping cart, validate your shopping cart. This checks to ensure there are no scheduling conflicts and checks to see if you meet the prerequisites to take the class. If you see a green check mark, this means you are good to enroll in the class.
 7. After you validate the classes in your shopping cart, go back to your shopping cart, click on the classes in your shopping cart, and click enroll. Remember that if a class is in your shopping cart, this does not mean you are enrolled in the class. You must finish this last step of enrolling in the class!
