How to View your Program Evaluation 1. Log in to your student center. You can access it by clicking on the pawprint on Chapman's main webpage and clicking student center.
2. Once in your student center, select the Academic Progress icon.
 3. Once in the Academic Progress icon, click on My Program Evaluation and View Report as PDF. If the PDF does not automatically open, it is because you have the popup block disabled in your web browser. Enable the pop-up blocker so you can access the document. Remember that your program evaluation is the best document to reference what requirements you have already completed and the remaining requirements to graduate.
4. To find GE courses to select, scroll down to the General Education section on your program evaluation and look for categories that say Not Satisfied. You will then search for approved GE courses in your student center to satisfy this requirement. Please reference the How to Search for GE handout.
