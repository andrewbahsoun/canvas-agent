Fowler School of Engineering - Academic Integrity Acknowledgement I certify that I have read and understand Chapman University's policy on academic integrity (https://www.chapman.edu/academics/academicintegrity/_files/academic-integrity-policy.pdf).
In addition to the examples listed in the policy document, I am aware that the following actions also constitute an academic integrity violation:
- Copying source code from another individual or the Internet without attribution. This includes copying code from subscription-based websites such as Chegg, private tutors, students who have taken the course previously, etc.
- Modifying someone else's code, without attribution, with the intention of claiming it as one's own work - Referencing solutions to exams or assignments from previous course offerings that have not been made publicly available by the instructor Furthermore, I understand that any instances of academic misconduct (regardless of circumstances or severity) in courses taught in the Fowler School of Engineering will result in a report to the university Academic Integrity Council along with a recommended sanction. Possible sanctions include, but are not limited to, a "F" in the course, a one semester suspension, or expulsion.
I certify that I have read and understand Chapman University's policy on academic integrity.
