Page 1 of 3 Undergraduate Reference Guide for Validating Courses STUDENTCENTER.CHAPMAN.EDU Found under 'Manage Classes" tile - COURSE VALIDATION - The validate feature helps students determine if they are eligible to add specific courses in the upcoming semester. Validating your courses will simulate registration to check ahead of time if you meet the requirements to add classes. We highly recommend that students validate ALL their courses ahead of time.
The validate button will check:
