Page 1 of 4 Undergraduate Reference Guide for Using the SWAP Function STUDENTCENTER.CHAPMAN.EDU Found under 'Manage Classes" tile - SWAP FEATURE - The SWAP feature allows you to replace one class with another and ensures that you are enrolled in an open course before dropping you from the other. When a course that you would like to add has a waitlist, we suggest using the SWAP feature to enroll in an open course and place yourself on the waitlist of another. If you get off the waitlist, the system will automatically drop you from the class you indicate and add you to your preferred class.
We strongly recommend adding an open class first and THEN setting up a SWAP with the waitlisted class. You CANNOT set up a SWAP if you add the waitlisted class first.
To use the SWAP feature, follow these steps:
- Enroll in open classes FIRST - you must first be enrolled in an open class and then set up a SWAP with your waitlisted course.
As a general rule, when you add classes to your shopping cart, make sure to toggle on the "Add to o waitlist if class is full?" - this will make it easier to use the SWAP if the class is waitlisted by the time you register:

Final thoughts on the SWAP feature:
- When adding your preferred class to your shopping cart, make sure to toggle on the "Add to Waitlist if class is full" - If you get off the waitlist, you will be automatically dropped from your indicated class and added to the other - We recommend using the SWAP tool when trying to switch from one section of a class to a different section of - the same class (ex. Switching from SPAN 101- section 01 to SPAN 101- section 02) or switch from one class to another class at the same time - Keep track of which classes you set a SWAP for! You will be responsible for any schedule changes made as a result of using the SWAP feature.
