Page 1 of 2 Undergraduate Reference Guide for Reviewing Account Holds STUDENTCENTER.CHAPMAN.EDU Found under "'Task" tile - HOLDS - Holds on student accounts are a method used by departments across campus to indicate the student must contact that department. Holds can be either described as being "positive" or "negative." Positive holds do not prevent a student from registering and usually provide some type of reminder or department notification.
- Negative holds will prevent a student from registering for classes and having their diploma mailed to them.
- Some offices/departments that use holds are the Business Office, the Office of the Registrar, the Health Center, Academic Advising, and the Dean of Students office.
We strongly recommend reviewing all Holds well in advance of registration.
To review any holds, follow these steps:
- When you enter your Student Center, look at your "Tasks" tile. If it says you have any holds, click on the Tile. In this example, the student has two holds on their account:
